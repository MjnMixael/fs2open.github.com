#ifndef _CHECKPOINTFIELDS_H
#define _CHECKPOINTFIELDS_H

/*
 * Field registries for the mission checkpoint system.
 *
 * Each list below names the runtime-mutable fields of one struct that a checkpoint captures.
 * The lists are expanded twice -- once to write and once to read -- so adding a saved field
 * is a one-line change in exactly one place, and the write and read sides can never drift
 * apart.
 *
 * The reader always supplies the freshly-created value as the default, so a field that is
 * absent from the file (because it was added to the engine after the checkpoint was written)
 * simply keeps whatever the mission load produced.  Likewise a field the file still carries
 * but the engine no longer has just disappears from the list and is ignored on read.  That is
 * what lets a checkpoint survive an engine update without any version gate.
 *
 * Only add a field here if it is genuinely mutable during a mission.  Anything derived from
 * the ship class, the model, or the mission file is reproduced by the mission load itself and
 * must not be captured -- writing it back would defeat table changes and waste space.
 *
 * Do NOT add pointers, handles, or indices into runtime arrays (objnum, model_instance_num,
 * sound handles, subsystem pointers).  Those are meaningless across a mission reload and are
 * handled by name elsewhere in missioncheckpoint.cpp.
 *
 * A TIMESTAMP FIELD BELONGS IN THE ..._STAMPS LIST, NEVER THE ..._INTS ONE.  Engine timestamps
 * are absolute values in a clock that runs from game launch, not from mission start, so a stamp
 * saved in one run means nothing in the next.  The stamps lists are the ones the restore shifts
 * into the current clock; see translate_stamp() in missioncheckpoint.cpp.  Put a timestamp in
 * an ints list and it will be restored verbatim, i.e. already long elapsed.  Both lists are
 * written to and read from the same map, so moving a field between them is not a file format
 * change and needs no version bump.
